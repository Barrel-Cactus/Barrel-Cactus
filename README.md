- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Barrel-Cactus
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ...
- answering the question about how to whitelist one site at a time on the Brave browser
- Simply click on Brave's shield icon while in the browser
- From there, go to change global shield defaults in the drop down menu (settings)
- Click on the drop down menu labled (additional settings) and select (privacy and security.)
- Go to (Site And Shield Settings)
- Go to (view permissions and data stored across site)
- clicking on any of the sites listed should allow you to individually allow permissions that other sites will still not have
- I hope this finds you well and resolves the problems you have encountered
